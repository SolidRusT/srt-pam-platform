OK, so I would like to continue working on our PAM project, in the `C:\Users\shaun\repos\srt-pam-platform` folder.

So far, I have been able to follow the instructions in the `README.md` file and bring up the docker compose environment. I am also able to hit all the endpoints mentioned in the `README.md` file.

Let's make an assessment of what we currently have in our repo so far, and figure our what to focus on next. By the end of this sprint, I need to have an example react app working with our GraphQL API.

My current workflow for working on the project is this:

`docker-compose up -d`

When any changes to the API are made, I go to the UI at: `http://localhost:4000/graphql` and update the tests in the `src/graphql/examples` folder, then run the tests.

For our react app in the `client` folder, I can successfully run `npm install && npm run dev` and get the app to run in the browser on http://localhost:3000/. We haven't integrated this into our `docker-compose.yml` file yet.

Current features that are confirmed to be working, or at least that I have manually tested successfully:

- GraphQL API
    - ServerInfo query
    - Register mutation
    - Login mutation
    - Logout mutation
    - verifyResetToken query
    - resetPassword mutation
- Client React app
    - user registration
    - login
    - logout
    - password reset

This seems to make sense with your assessment, but I'm not sure you've looked deep enough. Perhaps how I described my current workflow can help you to enhance your assessment even further.
