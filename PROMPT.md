OK, so I would like to continue working on our PAM project, in the `C:\Users\shaun\repos\srt-pam-platform` folder.

So far, I am able to follow the instructions in the `README.md` and bring up the docker compose environment. I am able to hit all the endpoints mentioned in the `README.md` file.

Let's make an assessment of what we currently have in our repo so far, and figure our what to focus on next. By the end of this sprint, I need to be able to register a user, login and get a valid token, logout and delete the token.

My current workflow for working on the GraphQL API is this:

`docker-compose down -v`
`docker rmi srt-pam-platform-api`
`docker-compose up -d`

Then I go to the UI at: `http://localhost:4000/graphql` and run some of the tests from the `src/graphql/examples` folder. Is this the best approach?

This seems to make sense with your assessment, but I'm not sure you've looked deep enough. Perhaps how I described my current workflow can help you to enhance your assessment even further.
